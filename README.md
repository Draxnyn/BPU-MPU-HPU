# BPU-MPU-HPU
Explanations about the 3 processor

# BPU (Basic Processor Unit):

- **The BPU is the simplest line of processors, as the name suggests. It is a basic processing unit mainly used for testing and educational purposes. It was the first processor to be created. The BPU typically has a 4-bit architecture and a low clock frequency in Hz.**

# MPU (Medium Processor Unit):

- **The MPU is a simple and acceptable processor for more advanced applications compared to the BPU. It features a unique 8-bit architecture and a reasonable clock frequency. Besides executing mathematical operations like Fibonacci, the MPU can produce graphical output, even if limited to a few pixels.**

# HPU (High Processor Unit):

- **The HPU is the most advanced processor in this line, featuring a 16-bit architecture and a high clock frequency. Unlike previous processors, it is not limited to basic mathematical sequences or simple graphics; the HPU can run more complex applications, such as games.**
